# Backend Overview

LaravelUi5 bridges two ecosystems — Laravel and OpenUI5 — by providing a consistent artifact model that spans both worlds. Each UI5 module you create has a backend representation (PHP) and a frontend counterpart (JavaScript). This duality is managed through unified conventions and a set of Artisan tools.

## Module Creation Strategies

LaravelUi5 supports both quick-start scaffolding for demos and structured integration of real-world UI5 projects.

### Quick Start Modules

Here’s an example you’ll also see in our quickstart video:

```bash
php artisan ui5:sca Users
```

This command creates a fully working example module under `ui5/Users`, including:
* `composer.json` with package metadata
* `src/UsersModule.php` defining the backend module entry point
* `src/UsersApp.php` defining the backend app entry point
* `resources/app/` containing a UI5 frontend app
* `UsersServiceProvider.php` to register the module

This entry point shows how easily a UI5 module can be wired into Laravel, without external setup. 

It's ideal for:
* demos and onboarding
* simple internal tools
* prototyping and experimentation

> ⚠️ Note: These modules are not meant to replace full-fledged UI5 projects.
> If you need TypeScript, test tooling, or advanced deployment pipelines, we recommend developing your UI5 app separately and integrating it via `ui5:app` or `ui5:lib`.

### Production-Ready Module Imports

The commands `ui5:app` and `ui5:lib` are designed to import artifacts from existing UI5 source projects into your Laravel environment. They assume:

* UI5 projects live *outside* the Laravel app (e.g. `../ui5-{domain}/`)
* LaravelUi5 pulls in a specific version snapshot of the source
* Artifacts are placed under `ui5/{Domain}/resources/ui5/`
* Matching backend integration (App class, Registry, ServiceProvider) is generated automatically

This is the recommended approach for integrating production-grade UI5 apps or libraries.


## Conventions

The following conventions define how imported UI5 modules are structured, named, and integrated within the Laravel app.

### Structure Conventions

In LaravelUi5, each UI5 application or library corresponds to exactly one *domain*.

Put differently: **one app equals one module equals one source project**. 

This strict one-to-one relationship ensures clean boundaries and predictable integration.

The domain name you choose — for example, `Users` or `Timesheet` — determines the identity and structure of the module on all levels.

* It defines the *PHP namespace*, which can be customized using the `--php-ns-prefix` option.
* It sets the *target folder* under `ui5/` inside the Laravel app, where the imported artifact will reside.
* It controls the *JavaScript namespace* used for UI5 resolution, configurable via the `--js-ns-prefix` option.

This convention keeps both backend and frontend aligned, and ensures that all generated artifacts remain modular, versionable, and easy to reason about.

> 📝 **Note**
> The `--js-ns-prefix` option only applies when using `ui5:sca` to generate a new module from scratch.
> When importing existing projects via `ui5:app` or `ui5:lib`, the JavaScript namespace is read from the project's `ui5.yaml` file and cannot be overridden.

### Filesystem Conventions

LaravelUi5 assumes a *shared workspace* where your Laravel app and all UI5 source projects live side by side:

```plaintext
your-workspace/
├── laravel-app/               ← The deployable Laravel project
├── ui5-core-lib/              ← Source project for a UI5 library
├── ui5-offers/                ← Source project for a UI5 application
└── io.pragmatiqu.budget/      ← Folder structure as generated by Easy UI5
```

This layout is *required* and cannot be changed.

**How It Works**

* UI5 source projects (like `ui5-offers`) are developed *outside* the Laravel project.
* LaravelUi5 provides Artisan commands (`ui5:app`, `ui5:lib`) to *import* a snapshot of the UI5 artifacts into the Laravel app.
* Imported artifacts are placed inside

```plaintext
laravel-app/
└── ui5/
    └── Offers/
        └── resources/
            └── ui5/           ← Application or library source lives here
```

This makes UI5 artifacts available for:

* Runtime serving via Laravel routes.
* Integration with the registry and system config.
* Deployment and packaging.

> 🛠️ This approach gives you the best of both worlds:
> full freedom during UI5 development and full control during Laravel deployment.

## Artifact Hierarchy

LaravelUi5 provides a structured artifact model inside the Laravel app, where UI5 components from external projects are *registered*, *organized*, and *integrated*.

Versioning itself happens in the UI5 source projects. LaravelUi5 pulls in specific versions as needed and exposes them as modular artifacts.

At the core of this model is a clear hierarchy:

* [Modules](./module) act as containers. They group related artifacts under a common domain but are not addressable on their own.
* [Libraries](./library) typically reflect a one-to-one copy of an external UI5 library project. They provide shared UI logic across modules or apps.
* [Applications](./app) are the logical root for user-facing content. They often serve as the anchor point for subordinate artifacts like [Cards](./card), [Reports](./report), [Tiles](./tile), and [KPIs](./kpi) — which derive their context from the app but can be composed and displayed independently.
* [Dashboards](./dashboard) are UI compositions that bring together Cards, Tiles, and KPIs into a cohesive interface. Dashboards are typically defined and rendered inside the Laravel project, and can be either static or dynamic.
* [Actions](./action) represent backend-only operations — such as toggling flags, triggering workflows, or executing custom logic. They are defined in Laravel and callable from UI5 via a unified API interface (`LaravelUi5.call(...)`), independent of any visual component.

This abstraction layer makes it easy to reason about complex UI5 landscapes while keeping everything modular and environment-aware.
