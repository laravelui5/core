# Architectural Overview

LaravelUi5 promotes a clean **separation of concerns** between the backend (Laravel) and the frontend (OpenUI5), enabling a scalable and maintainable architecture suitable for professional business applications.

Here’s how the pieces fit together:

## Backend — Laravel

* **API-first**: Laravel serves as a JSON API provider using standard routes and controllers.
* **Business Logic**: Handles authentication, authorization, data processing, and domain rules.
* **Database & Models**: Uses Eloquent ORM or any Laravel-supported DB layer for persistence.
* **App Shell**: Laravel serves a UI5 app entrypoint (e.g., `index.html`) and static assets.

## Frontend — OpenUI5

* **Fully client-side**: Built as modular UI5 apps with MVC or MVVM patterns.
* **Data Binding**: Connects to Laravel APIs using `ODataModel` or custom logic.
* **Routing & Views**: Managed via UI5’s flexible routing system.
* **Component-based**: Uses reusable UI5 controls and XML views to structure the UI.

## Development Workflow

* **In Development**: UI5 apps are served via **LaravelUi5**, which takes care of linking development resources and resolving them cleanly within the Laravel context — no manual wiring required.
* **In Production**: UI5 apps are built (bundled, minified) and shipped as static assets **within Composer packages**, making them easy to version, distribute, and deploy alongside your Laravel app.
* **Optional Integration**: UI5 apps are typically organized per module, but can also be grouped by feature for more workflow-driven interfaces.

This architecture allows both frontend and backend teams to work independently — or as one — while keeping codebases clean, testable, and future-proof.
