# What is LaravelUi5?

**LaravelUi5** is a lightweight SDK and runtime environment that bridges the gap between [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [OpenUI5](https://openui5.org/), allowing developers to build modern, enterprise-grade web applications with a clean separation of frontend and backend responsibilities.

It's a production-ready integration layer to run SAP OpenUI5 frontends seamlessly on Laravel backends. Full support for SAP-compliant Security Token Handling (X-CSRF-Token), OData v4 services via [flat3/lodata](https://github.com/flat3/lodata/pull/860), and hybrid UI5 + Laravel APIs.

**LaravelUi5** was built to bridge the worlds of enterprise-grade UI5 frontends and modern Laravel application backends. With simplicity, security, and full SAP compatibility in mind.

At its core, LaravelUi5 enables you to:

* Develop OpenUI5 apps independently while seamlessly integrating them into a Laravel backend.
* Support efficient OpenUI5 application workflows for both development and production, with a clear path from local development to deployable builds.
* Use Laravel for data models, APIs, authentication, and backend logic — while OpenUI5 handles the user interface, following [SAP Fiori design principles](https://www.sap.com/design-system/?external) if desired.
* Migrate from legacy SAP Gateway or Java stacks to Laravel/PHP
* Deliver SAP UX with modern Laravel-based flexibility and cost efficiency

It’s ideal for developers who want to:

* Combine the robustness and developer-friendliness of Laravel with the powerful UI capabilities of OpenUI5.
* Build business apps without needing a full SAP stack or SAP BTP.
* Follow a clean architecture that supports scale, testing, and modularity.

LaravelUi5 is **open**, **framework-agnostic on the frontend**, and designed with **progressive adoption** in mind.

Start small and grow your architecture over time.
