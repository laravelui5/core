# Internal IT Team Modernizing Legacy Business Tools

An internal IT department at a logistics company is tasked with modernizing several legacy tools used for managing fleet schedules, shift planning, and fuel cost tracking. The existing tools are a mix of outdated Excel macros and PHP scripts with rudimentary interfaces.

The team wants to:

* **Standardize the frontend** across tools with a consistent, professional UX.
* **Maintain Laravel** as their backend framework of choice.
* Ensure long-term maintainability and reduce dependency on frontend micro-framework sprawl.

They adopt **LaravelUi5** to introduce a structured frontend architecture based on OpenUI5, giving them a rich component library, built-in accessibility, and a responsive layout system right out of the box.

With LaravelUi5:

* Each tool is gradually rebuilt as a modular UI5 app backed by Laravel APIs.
* Developers focus on data and logic in Laravel, while frontend engineers build reusable UI components.
* The result feels like an internal SAP-grade suite, without the cost or complexity of SAP integration.

## Result

* Modern, unified UIs across all internal tools.
* Faster development cycles with clearer code separation.
* Empowered IT team capable of maintaining and extending tools independently.
