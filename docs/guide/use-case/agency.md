# Laravel Agency Delivering a Custom HR Dashboard

A small Laravel agency is hired by a mid-sized manufacturing company to build an internal HR dashboard for tracking employee hours, project budgets, and training metrics. The client expects:

* A desktop-first, enterprise-grade user interface.
* Role-based access control and multilingual support.
* Seamless integration with existing backend APIs and data sources.

Rather than building everything from scratch with Blade or Vue, the agency chooses **LaravelUi5**. They use OpenUI5 for the frontend, delivering a SAP Fiori–inspired UX that aligns with the client’s internal standards — *without needing SAP infrastructure.*

Laravel handles authentication, business logic, and API orchestration. The UI5 frontend is developed in parallel and integrated cleanly using LaravelUi5’s SDK.

## Result

* Faster development through UI5’s pre-built components.
* Clear separation between backend and frontend codebases.
* A maintainable, enterprise-style app that impresses both stakeholders and end users.
