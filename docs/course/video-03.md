# Core Setup

Now that LaravelUi5 Core is installed, I’ll show you how to wire it into your Laravel project. We’ll register the `Ui5CoreServiceProvider`, adjust the middleware stack, publish the config file, and set up your `.env` for development. This gives you a fully UI5-ready Laravel app — explicit, modular, and under your control.
