# Installing LaravelUi5

In this lesson, I’ll walk you through setting up a clean Laravel project and installing LaravelUi5 Core. You’ll learn why we use `composer create-project` instead of `laravel new`, how to handle forks and VCS repositories, and how to configure Composer’s `minimum-stability` setting. By the end, you’ll have LaravelUi5 installed and ready to go inside a fresh Laravel baseline.
