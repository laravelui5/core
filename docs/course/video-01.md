# Welcome

In this first video I’ll show you why LaravelUi5 exists and how it can completely change the way you build business-grade frontends in Laravel.
You’ll see what makes UI5 different from frameworks like Vue or React, why it’s a perfect fit for enterprise apps, and what we’ll be building together in this course.
By the end, you’ll know exactly what to expect and be ready to scaffold your first UI5 app inside Laravel.
