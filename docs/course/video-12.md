# This is Just the Beginning

You did it — you built and shipped your first real UI5 app inside Laravel.
From scaffolding a module, wiring up OData, and creating declarative XML views, all the way to controller logic and backend actions — you’ve touched the full MVC flow of OpenUI5 and made it work Laravel-native.

In this closing video, I’ll recap what you’ve really learned:

* Declarative UI in XML, bound to OData models
* Controllers for interactivity and business logic
* Clean, modular app structure with LaravelUi5
* Full-stack roundtrips powered by `LaravelUi5.call()`

And then we’ll zoom out. You’ll see how easy it is to deploy your app with Forge, Cloud, or plain Laravel hosting. We’ll talk about scaling to dashboards, KPIs, and multi-tenant SaaS apps — and I’ll invite you to the **LaravelUi5 SDK — Founder Edition**, where we go deeper and build production-ready apps together.

This isn’t the end. It’s the start of something much bigger. You’ve got the foundation — now it’s up to you to grow it.
