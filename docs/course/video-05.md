# Enabling OData

In this video, we’ll connect your UI to real data using OData. You’ll see why UI5 was built to talk to structured APIs, how the Lodata package brings OData v4 into Laravel, and how easy it is to expose your `User` model as a discoverable OData endpoint. By the end, Laravel will be speaking UI5’s native data language.
