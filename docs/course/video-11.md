# The Lock Function

In this final UI-focused video, we’ll build a full-stack roundtrip: a “Toggle Lock” action for users. You’ll see how to add a lock icon, wire up a button, scaffold a Ui5Action, and connect everything from UI to backend and back again. One click changes the database and updates the UI instantly — a clean Laravel-native integration that shows the power of the LUX stack.
