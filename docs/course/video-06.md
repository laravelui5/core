# Configuration

Here I’ll explain how enterprise systems use multiple stages — DEV, QS, and PRO — and how LaravelUi5 makes that explicit in `config/ui5.php`. You’ll learn how to declare system boundaries, attach different middleware per system, and switch environments with just one setting in `.env`. This is where LaravelUi5 really starts to feel enterprise-ready.
