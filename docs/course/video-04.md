# Scaffolding a Self-Contained UI5 App

Here’s where it gets exciting — we’ll scaffold our very first UI5 app using `php artisan ui5:sca`. I’ll explain what gets generated, why each file matters, and how to register the module. Then we’ll start the dev server and see the OpenUI5 welcome screen live in the browser. From now on, you’ll be building real, modular UI5 apps inside Laravel.
