# SAP & the Rest of Us

This episode zooms out. We’ll look at how SAP uses OData for massive enterprise systems, why that’s overkill for Laravel projects, and how LaravelUi5 takes a pragmatic approach: OData for reads, actions for writes. You’ll see how Ui5Actions and the `LaravelUi5.call()` facade make full-stack interactions natural for Laravel developers.
