Software shouldn’t rely on external documentation to explain itself. It should rather be able to speak from within.</p><p>This companion article shows how that idea becomes real inside LaravelUi5. Not through magic or convention, but through architecture: first <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/laravelui5/core" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Core</a>, then the <a href="https://pragmatiqu.io/laravelui5/sdk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sdk</a>.</p><p>Let’s walk through it in the way developers appreciate, from structure, to capability, to experience.</p><h2 id="why-a-meta-layer-belongs-in-the-architecture" tabindex="-1">Why a Meta Layer Belongs in the Architecture <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-a-meta-layer-belongs-in-the-architecture" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why a Meta Layer Belongs in the Architecture&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Modern applications already carry an enormous amount of knowledge about themselves:</p><ul><li>which modules exist,</li><li>which features belong to which domain,</li><li>which actions are possible,</li><li>which screens and routes matter,</li><li>which states, roles, or flows define meaning.</li></ul><p>Traditionally, none of this knowledge is available to a help system. It lives in the code, implicitly, and stays inaccessible to anything outside the code.</p><p>So teams compensate: wikis, onboarding calls, training slides, scattered documentation.</p><p>LaravelUi5 takes a different approach. It turns the knowledge <em>inside</em> the codebase into a structured, explicit layer. A layer that other systems (including Help) can understand and build upon.</p><p>That layer begins with <a href="https://github.com/laravelui5/core" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LaravelUi5/Core</a>.</p><h2 id="giving-the-application-a-vocabulary" tabindex="-1">Giving the Application a Vocabulary <a class="header-anchor" href="#giving-the-application-a-vocabulary" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Giving the Application a Vocabulary&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Core is not a help system. It is the <a href="https://laravelui5.com/blog/2025/11/21/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">descriptive foundation</a> that makes any kind of meta layer possible.</p><p>Core gives each module, feature, action, and report:</p><ul><li>a <strong>stable identity</strong>,</li><li>a <strong>clear place in the module tree</strong>,</li><li>and a <strong>declarative description</strong> through typed PHP attributes.</li></ul><p>Developers write clean Laravel code. Core observes, reflects, and gathers the declarations into a single structure: the <a href="https://laravelui5.com/api/LaravelUi5.Core.Ui5.Contracts.Ui5RegistryInterface.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ui5Registry</a>.</p><p>You can think of the registry as the application’s self-awareness. It knows:</p><ul><li>which modules exist,</li><li>which artifacts those modules expose,</li><li>what each artifact is meant to do,</li><li>how features relate,</li><li>which abilities belong to which actions,</li><li>how navigation should behave.</li></ul><p>All of this is generated by scanning the code.</p><p>Core does not produce help content. But it exposes the <em>shape</em> of the system with enough precision that a help layer can read it.</p><p>Core provides the foundation. The <a href="https://pragmatiqu.io/laravelui5/sdk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sdk</a> builds the living system on top.</p><h2 id="from-description-to-understanding" tabindex="-1">From Description to Understanding <a class="header-anchor" href="#from-description-to-understanding" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;From Description to Understanding&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Once the registry exists, something becomes possible that is normally very difficult. The system can be understood from within.</p><p>If a module declares its screens and actions, and if these declarations live in a versioned, unified registry, then the help system doesn’t need to guess.</p><p>It can:</p><ul><li>identify where the user is,</li><li>map the UI location to a module,</li><li>discover the relevant concept or feature,</li><li>and select the correct help topic.</li></ul><p>This is why the meta layer is not a bolt-on feature in LaravelUi5. It’s the natural outcome of Core’s reflective design.</p><p>In other words…</p><blockquote><p><strong>Core doesn’t implement help. Core makes help possible.</strong></p></blockquote><p>The Sdk does the rest.</p><h2 id="bringing-the-meta-layer-to-life" tabindex="-1">Bringing the Meta Layer to Life <a class="header-anchor" href="#bringing-the-meta-layer-to-life" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Bringing the Meta Layer to Life&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The <a href="https://pragmatiqu.io/laravelui5/sdk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sdk</a> extends Core in the same spirit Laravel extends Symfony. Quietly, respectfully, without breaking the underlying foundation.</p><p>Where Core describes, the <em>Sdk operationalizes</em>.</p><p>This includes the entire runtime needed for a living help system.</p><p><strong>Context Resolution</strong></p><p>The Sdk reads the registry and determines where the user is in the application. It knows the module, the feature, the artifact, the screen, the state.</p><p><strong>Help Service &amp; Adapter</strong></p><p>This small service receives the current context and decides which help topic belongs to it. If a topic exists at that exact location, it’s selected. If not, the system climbs the module tree until it finds the right level of abstraction.</p><p><strong>Per-Module Help Trees</strong></p><p>Each module ships its own help content (Markdown files). Content stays versioned with the module.</p><p><strong>Help Registry</strong></p><p>The Sdk collects all help trees into a single, searchable structure. This registry mirrors the structure created by Core, just with documentation attached.</p><p><strong>Viewer &amp; Search Overlay</strong></p><p>Help is rendered into a clean HTML viewer, with deep linking, i18n, and instant search.</p><p><strong>The F1 Workflow</strong></p><p>When the user presses F1, the Sdk resolves context, finds the matching help topic, and opens the viewer.</p><p>This is what transforms the conceptual idea of “software that can speak” into a daily experience.</p><h2 id="what-this-means-for-developers" tabindex="-1">What This Means for Developers <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-this-means-for-developers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What This Means for Developers&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Because the meta layer grows out of Core, using it requires no special discipline from developers.</p><ul><li>Write your modules cleanly.</li><li>Describe your artifacts using attributes.</li><li>Add help content as Markdown inside the module.</li><li>Run your builds.</li><li>Ship your release.</li></ul><p>The Sdk takes the descriptive foundation from Core and turns it into a help system that</p><ul><li>never drifts out of sync,</li><li>travels with your deployments,</li><li>respects version boundaries,</li><li>works across modules,</li><li>and speaks the same language as your code.</li></ul><p>Your job is simply to write the truths of your system in one place, the code. Everything else flows from that.</p><h2 id="a-layer-we-forgot-to-build" tabindex="-1">A Layer We Forgot to Build <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-layer-we-forgot-to-build" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A Layer We Forgot to Build&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Most applications treat help as content. LaravelUi5 treats help as architecture.</p><p>Core gives the system the ability to describe itself. The Sdk gives it the ability to speak.</p><p>Together, they form the meta layer the industry has overlooked for decades, a layer where understanding finally has a home inside the product, not outside of it.</p><p>If you’d like to explore the architectural story behind this idea, read the companion essay on Pragmatiqu.io:</p><p><a href="https://pragmatiqu.io/archive/2025/12/05" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">When Software Learns to Speak</a></p><p>And if you want to build systems where explanation is built-in instead of bolted-on, start with <a href="https://github.com/laravelui5/core" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LaravelUi5/Core</a> and bring it to life with the <a href="https://pragmatiqu.io/laravelui5/sdk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sdk</a>.</p>',61)])])}const m=t(o,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
