 * Contract for classes that accept declarative, resolved request parameters.

 * Implementations must support an immutable "wither" to inject a typed
 * argument bag (Ui5Args) and expose a read accessor for usage in domain code.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - withArgs(Ui5Args) MUST NOT mutate the instance; return a cloned instance.
 * - args() MUST always return a Ui5Args (empty bag if nothing was injected).
 *
 * Typical implementers:
 * - Report data providers
 * - Resource data providers
 * - Action handlers
