/**
 * Contract for classes that consume declarative settings/configuration.
 *
 * Implementations must support an immutable "wither" to inject a typed
 * configuration bag (Ui5Config) and expose a read accessor for usage
 * in domain code.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - In Core, the resolver may provide defaults only.
 * - In the SDK, a database-backed resolver can supply effective values
 *   (scope precedence, casting).
 *
 * Rules:
 * - withConfig(Ui5Config) MUST NOT mutate the instance; return a clone.
 * - config() MUST always return a Ui5Config (empty bag if nothing injected).
 *
 * Typical implementers:
 * - Resource/Report providers that read feature flags or limits
 * - Action handlers with tunable behavior
