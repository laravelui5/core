/**
 * Contract for UI5 Actions.
 *
 * A UI5 Action represents a state-changing operation that can be invoked
 * from a UI5 client via the generic API dispatcher. Typical examples are:
 * - "toggle-lock" on a user
 * - "approve-invoice"
 * - "discard-draft"
 *
 * Characteristics:
 * - Actions are always *mutating* operations (never pure reads).
 * - Therefore, they must only be exposed as *POST endpoints*.
 * - Route parameters (IDs, slugs) are declared on the Action and resolved
 *   via {@see ParameterizableInterface}. The dispatcher validates and
 *   injects these before calling the handler.
 * - Body parameters (form data, payloads) are validated *inside the
 *   ActionHandler*, following Laravel best practices.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Define the actionâ€™s slug (via {@see SluggableInterface}).
 * - Optionally implement {@see ParameterizableInterface} to declare
 *   URI parameters.
 * - Provide the {@see ActionHandlerInterface} that executes the logic.
 *
 * Each Action must have a unique slug within its module. The slug is used
 * to generate the manifest entry and the API route.
