/**
 * Declarative setting definition for Configurable classes.
 *
 * Apply this attribute multiple times on a class (e.g., Action handler, Resource/Data provider,
 * Report provider) to declare the settings it depends on.
 *
 *  **When to Use Settings vs. Custom Database Models**
 *
 *  The *Settings API* is designed for lightweight, flexible configuration values that can be expressed as simple key–value pairs (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, dates).
 *  It works well when the configuration is *UI-driven, ephemeral, or low-risk*:
 *
 *   - UI filters and personalization (e.g., a card showing weekly hours for selected employees).
 *   - Display preferences (e.g., default currency, theme, date range presets).
 *   - Feature toggles or thresholds that may change frequently.
 *   - Lists of IDs that serve as filters, *as long as you accept weak references* (IDs stored without DB-level foreign keys).
 *
 *  By contrast, a *custom database model* should be used when the configuration expresses a *business relationship or critical domain rule*:
 *
 *   - Relationships that must be referentially intact (e.g., employees assigned to cost centers).
 *   - Audit-relevant or legally binding data (e.g., who is eligible for billing, regulatory roles).
 *   - Data that requires strong constraints, migrations, or reporting queries (joins, aggregates).
 *   - Long-lived associations where zombie IDs (deleted or reassigned objects) are unacceptable.
 *
 *  **Rule of Thumb**
 *
 *   If a value is *ephemeral, UI-scoped, or best-effort* → *Settings* are pragmatic and safe.
 *   If a value is *domain-critical, audited, or relational in nature* → design a *dedicated DB model*.
 *
 *  **Notes**
 *
 *   Weak foreign keys in Settings (e.g., arrays of BusinessPartner IDs) are acceptable if you *sanitize them at runtime* (ignore IDs that no longer exist).
 *   Settings should always store JSON-safe primitives (string, int, float, bool, date in ISO-8601, arrays thereof).
 *   You trade off *referential integrity* for *developer speed*. This is intentional.
 *
 *  **Example**
 *
 *  ```#[Setting(
 *      key: 'billing.settlement.validation.maxHours',
 *      type: SettingValueType::Integer,
 *      default: 8,
 *      scope: SettingScope::Tenant,
 *      visibilityRole: SettingVisibilityRole::TenantAdmin
 *  )]```
