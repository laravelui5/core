/**
 * Ensures that only the latest version of a UI5 app artifact is accessible.
 *
 * This middleware checks whether the requested version of the UI5 application
 * (as provided in the route parameters) matches the currently registered version
 * in the resolved Ui5RuntimeContext. If the version does not match, a 410 Gone
 * response is returned to indicate that the requested artifact version is no longer available.
 *
 * Note: This middleware requires that the Ui5RuntimeContext has already been resolved
 * and registered in the service container. It should therefore be placed
 * **after** the `ResolveUi5RuntimeContext` middleware in the route or middleware stack.
 *
 * This middleware is **not applied by default** and should be explicitly included
 * for routes that require strict version enforcement.
