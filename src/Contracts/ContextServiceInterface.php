 * Interface ContextServiceInterface

 * required by UI5 applications at runtime.

 * The resolved context typically includes settings, abilities, user info,
 * and other domain-specific fragments contributed by registered providers.
 *
 * The service supports two modes of use:
 * 1. In HTTP/UI5 environments, where the context is built and injected automatically via middleware
 * 2. In background jobs, tests, or CLI tools, where a context may need to be constructed manually
